Vulners Agent is open source agent, which provides vulnerability assessment for linux-based systems. Agent solution perfoms scanning with minimum commands for execution and as a result achieve extremely fast scan.  Agent is developed with Python and uses OS environment variables to detect used Python version.

Agent gathers information about operating system, it's version and installed packages. These information is sent to vulners.com API and results can be viewed via [vulners.com audit result](https://vulners.com/audit)

# Agent installation

## Configure repository

### For rhel-based linux:

Create file **/etc/yum.repos.d/vulners.repo**

For rhel6:

```
[vulners]
name=Vulners Agent
baseurl=https://repo.vulners.com/redhat/el6/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.vulners.com/pubkey.txt
```

For rhel7:
```
[vulners]
name=Vulners Agent
baseurl=https://repo.vulners.com/redhat/el7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.vulners.com/pubkey.txt
```

### For debian-based linux:

First add vulners.com pubkey:
```
wget -O- https://repo.vulners.com/pubkey.txt | apt-key add -
```

After this create file **/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vulners.list**
```
deb http://repo.vulners.com/debian jessie main
```

## Install packet:

### RHEL
```yum install vulners-agent```

### Debian
```apt-get update && apt-get install vulners-agent```

### Source code (We don't recommend this way)
You could clone source code of package and perform scans using python. 
According best practices you should use virtual environment
* install requirements.txt with ```pip3 install -r vulners-agent/requirements.txt```
* configure agent as described below
* run ```python3 vulners-agent/application --app Scanner```

## Agent configuration
Now you should get api-key for agent registration. Log in to vulners.com, go to [userinfo space] (https://vulners.com/userinfo) . Then you should choose "apikey" section.
Choose "scan" in scope menu and click "Generate new key". You will get an api-key, which looks like this:
**RGB9YPJG7CFAXP35PMDVYFFJPGZ9ZIRO1VGO9K9269B0K86K6XQQQR32O6007NUK**

You'll need to write this key into agent configuration. You should use only one api key for all your agents. Agent configuration is located in file /etc/vulners/vulners_agent.conf
Change parameter api_key in section agent. Here is example of config file:

```
[DEFAULT]
api_key = RGB9YPJG7CFAXP35PMDVYFFJPGZ9ZIRO1VGO9K9269B0K86K6XQQQR32O6007NUK
```

## Agent execution

During first run agent will automatically register with configured api_key

To perform your system scan run ```vulners-agent --app Scanner```.

After this you may look at agent status and scanning results at https://vulners.com/audit

## Advanced configuration

Using /etc/vulners/vulners_agent.conf you can override part of the identification parameters.

```
[DEFAULT]
api_key = RGB9YPJG7CFAXP35PMDVYFFJPGZ9ZIRO1VGO9K9269B0K86K6XQQQR32O6007NUK

[Ticker]
ip_address = 10.0.0.1
fqdn = my.host.example.com
mac_address = 00:01:02:03:04:06
interval = 3h30m

```
